# Provi Week Challenge

The [Provi Week] is an initiative from [@provicapital] to help students to be hired as developers üê±‚Äçüíª

## Context

- We talked a [little about it here], you can watch again if you want to
- The idea is to build a small application to practice structured thinking, OOP, tests, modularity and abstraction

## ü•ã The challenge

The goal is to ship a piece of software that will handle a login system. In a normal login system, you usually can:

1. login
1. logout
1. reset your password
1. change password
1. change email
1. avoid email duplication
1. get information about the sessions of the users

### üì¶ What are the deliverables:

- It should use a fake, temporary, in memory database, like a javascript `Array` or `Object`, or a python `dict`
  or `list`
- It should use Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, inheritance)
- It should have an executable file (e.g: `index.js` or `main.py`) where all the logic is executed
- It should have tests for the main logic
- It should be documented
- It should focus on code reusability and modularity
- It should be open sourced on your GitHub repo

### ‚úîÔ∏è What we would like to see

- evaluate your ability to think in a structured way
- evaluate your ability to follow strict business rules
- evaluate your ability to write modular, testable code

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What you do not need to do:

- integrate a real database
- create APIs
- create a frontend interface
- deploy this code somewhere

### ü§ì Useful resources:

- [ProviCapital] training to help our students to be hired
- First video of the [Provi Week]

### üíØ Just finished?
